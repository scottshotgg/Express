# TODO

## MAIN SHIT: <br>

- try making a single mega switch that we can use in group, array, and block
- ~~BOOTSTRAP the `ParseBlock()` program flow~~ - **DONE**
- rebuild data/program flow - **ALMOST**
- ~~rearch the entire lexing process~~ - **DONE**
- ~~rearch the parsing process and use the `Parsemeta` object~~ - **FINISHED**
- make a `lex_test.go` and a `parse_test.go` file for individualized tests - **AFTER BOOTSTRAPPING**
- implement `getX()` chain: - **STARTED**
  - `getStatement()`
  - `getExpr()`
  - `getTerm()`
  - `getFactor()`
  - etc

- ~~ultimately end up with a parser that can parse primitives, as well as arrays, and multi-type objects with different types of assignment statements for now~~ - **FINISHED**

might look into doing some letters from other natural languages (ie, `forwardtick`)
