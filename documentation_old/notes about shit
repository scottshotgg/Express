program    -> block
block      -> []statements
statement  -> block, assignment_expression
assignment_expression -> ident assign_op expression
expression -> term (+|-) term
term       -> factor (*|/) factor
factor     -> ident, literal, (expression)

ex:
for i := 2, i < 10, i++ {}

trace would be:
-> program
-> block
-> statement
-> "then it would see for and start the 'for' parse"
-> standard for is defined as "for", assignment expression, boolean expression, increment expression, block
